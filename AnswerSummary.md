# Java Basic Objects Practice

## Array Test
 1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- [Stack Class in Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-class-in-java/)

## Collection Test
- [Iterators in Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterators-in-java/)
- [Generics in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-generics)


2.Why the test failed at first?
- It's because the expected result is originally set to 0 or some pre-fixed value while "assertEquals()/assertThrows()" compare the expected and the actual result and output a Boolean as the comparison result. 

3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- So that the expected result should be matched to the actual result which is stated in each unit test

4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
 - Should be okay
